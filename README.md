To use your customized package in a Nova app, add this line in the `require` section of the `composer.json` file:

```

":vendor/:package_name": "*",

```

In the same `composer.json` file add a `repositiories` section with the path to your package repo:

```

"repositories": [
{
    "type": "path",
    "url": "../:package_name"
},

```

Now you're ready to develop your package inside a Nova app.

**When you are done with the steps above delete everything above!**

Add a screenshot of the tool here.

## Installation

You can install the package in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash

composer require :vendor/:package_name

```

Next up, you must register the tool with Nova. This is typically done in the `tools` method of the `NovaServiceProvider`.

```php

// in app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php
// ...
public function tools()
{
    return [
        // ...
        new \:namespace_vendor\:namespace_tool_name\:namespace_tool_nameTool(),
    ];
}

```

## Usage

Click on the ":package_name" menu item in your Nova app to see the tool provided by this package.

## Testing

``` bash

composer test

```
